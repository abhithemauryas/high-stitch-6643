                    <p>DeskTime was born out of the need for the<a> Draugiem Group </a>to manage <br> their many employees. An internal application was developed, and we <br> soon realized that we'd made a tool that could be useful for many other <br> companies. Why not offer it to them? - we thought. And so, the <br> development began.</p>
                    <p>At DeskTime, we’re committed to accountability, transparency, and <br> fairness. DeskTime is a product designed to increase productivity in an <br> open and empowering environment. The added benefit? Boosting your <br> employees and motivating them to perform at 100% of their potential.</p>

It's the best way to manage shared and hybrid <br> workspaces, and another step closer to DeskTime becoming an all-in-one <br> office management system.</p>
